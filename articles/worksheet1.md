Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

**Benefits of cloud computing**
<br>
<br>
1.<u>Cost</u>
<br>
Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.
<br>
<br>
2.<u>Speed</u>
<br>
Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.
<br>
<br>
3.<u>Global scale</u>
<br>
The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when it is needed and from the right geographic location.
<br>
<br>
4.<u>Productivity</u>
<br>
On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
<br>
<br>
5.<u>Performance</u>
<br>
The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.
<br>
<br>
6.<u>Reliability</u>
<br>
Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.
<br>
<br>
7.<u>Security</u>
<br>
Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps and infrastructure from potential threats.
<br>
<br>
**Virtualization**
<br>
Virtualization is a technique of how to separate a service from the underlying physical delivery of that service. It is the process of creating a virtual version of something like computer hardware. 
<br>
The types of virtualization are as follows:
<br>
1.<u>Application Virtualization: </u>
<br>
Application virtualization helps a user to have remote access of an application from a server. The server stores all personal information and other characteristics of the application but can still run on a local workstation through the internet. Example of this would be a user who needs to run two different versions of the same software. Technologies that use application virtualization are hosted applications and packaged applications. 
<br>
<br>
2.<u>Network Virtualization: </u>
<br>
The ability to run multiple virtual networks with each has a separate control and data plan. It co-exists together on top of one physical network. It can be managed by individual parties that potentially confidential to each other. 
Network virtualization provides a facility to create and provision virtual networks—logical switches, routers, firewalls, load balancer, Virtual Private Network (VPN), and workload security within days or even in weeks. 
<br>
<br>
3.<u>Desktop Virtualization: </u>
<br>
Desktop virtualization allows the users’ OS to be remotely stored on a server in the data centre. It allows the user to access their desktop virtually, from any location by a different machine. Users who want specific operating systems other than Windows Server will need to have a virtual desktop. Main benefits of desktop virtualization are user mobility, portability, easy management of software installation, updates, and patches. 
<br>
<br>
4.<u>Storage Virtualization: </u> 
<br>
Storage virtualization is an array of servers that are managed by a virtual storage system. The servers aren’t aware of exactly where their data is stored, and instead function more like worker bees in a hive. It makes managing storage from multiple sources to be managed and utilized as a single repository. storage virtualization software maintains smooth operations, consistent performance and a continuous suite of advanced functions despite changes, break down and differences in the underlying equipment. 
<br>
<br>
5.<u>Server Virtualization: </u>
<br>
This is a kind of virtualization in which masking of server resources takes place. Here, the central-server(physical server) is divided into multiple different virtual servers by changing the identity number, processors. So, each system can operate its own operating systems in isolate manner. Where each sub-server knows the identity of the central server. It causes an increase in the performance and reduces the operating cost by the deployment of main server resources into a sub-server resource. It’s beneficial in virtual migration, reduce energy consumption, reduce infrastructural cost, etc.
<br>
<br>
6.<u>Data virtualization: </u>
<br>
This is the kind of virtualization in which the data is collected from various sources and managed that at a single place without knowing more about the technical information like how data is collected, stored & formatted then arranged that data logically so that its virtual view can be accessed by its interested people and stakeholders, and users through the various cloud services remotely. Many big giant companies are providing their services like Oracle, IBM, At scale, Cdata, etc.
